\title{GDH Model - Richardson - for heat accumulation}
\usage{
gdhr_model(x, total = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector containing temperature values (Celsius-degree).}

\item{total}{TRUE Shows the total value of accumulation, FALSE shows the value of GDH for each temperature (TRUE is default).}
}
\value{
The function returns values the GDH for each temperature of vector.
}
\description{
Quantifies the Growing Degree Hours at between the base and optimum temperatures.
}
\details{
The GDH model is based on the subtraction of the base temperature of each hourly temperature between 4.5°C and 25°C. The temperature of the base is 4.5°C. Therefore, accumulation under temperatures below 4.5°C and above 25°C is zero.
